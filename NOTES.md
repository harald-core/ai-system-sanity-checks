# Notes

This repository is intentionally incomplete.

These notes capture observations, questions, and conceptual edges
that arise while reasoning about AI system behavior at scale.

Some ideas will remain unresolved.
Some checks may contradict each other.

That is expected.

The goal is not correctness.
The goal is early detection of silent failure.
## Learning Context

These notes are extended while following structured learning paths
(e.g. IBM / Coursera) focused on AI systems, evaluation, and reliability.

The goal is not implementation, but developing a clear mental model
for testing AI-driven systems and understanding failure patterns.
